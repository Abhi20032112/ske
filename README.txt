SK Enterprises - Responsive Website (Static)

How to run:
1) Unzip the file.
2) Open 'index.html' in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). Thatâ€™s it.

Pages included:
- index.html (Homepage with hero slider, product tiles, clients, gallery preview, CTA)
- about.html
- products.html (category-wise products)
- clients.html
- gallery.html
- contact.html (NO MAP, with mailto form)

Customize:
- Replace placeholder images in assets/img/
- Update text in HTML files
- Adjust colors/spacing in assets/css/style.css

Notes:
- Contact form uses your default email app (mailto). For server-side processing, connect to a backend or a service like Formspree/EmailJS.
